🧾 Project Title
Nipah Outbreak Risk Mapping & Response Simulator (NORMS)
A Deterministic Spatial-Temporal Modeling Web Application for Early Epidemic Risk Estimation and Intervention Planning

📌 Problem Statement
The Nipah virus is a high-fatality zoonotic disease with a history of outbreaks in South and Southeast Asia. Despite its severity, early detection and outbreak preparedness at the district or state level remain underdeveloped due to lack of tools that incorporate ecological and healthcare factors.

Local authorities and healthcare workers need a semi-dynamic, interpretable system to estimate outbreak risk based on real-world parameters like bat host presence, pig-human interaction, fruit contamination, and healthcare accessibility. This project aims to address this gap by building a non-AI-based deterministic epidemic risk simulation and mapping tool.

🎯 Objective
To develop a web-based decision support system that:

Maps and quantifies Nipah virus outbreak risk across regions using deterministic modeling.

Simulates temporal changes in risk due to seasonal or ecological shifts.

Enables scenario testing with public health interventions.

Generates risk reports for policy planners and response teams.

🔍 Key Features
Interactive Risk Mapping

Map-based region selection (using Leaflet.js or Mapbox)

Dynamic color-coded choropleth based on real-time calculated risk scores

Multi-Parameter Risk Estimation Engine

Inputs: Bat density, pig-human proximity, fruit exposure index, healthcare infrastructure score, urban-wildlife interface

Normalized and weighted risk formula

Each parameter is normalized between 0 and 1. The weights are user-configurable to allow contextual tuning.

🧪 Outcome
A usable web application that models Nipah outbreak risk realistically using static and simulated data.

A tool for scenario planning without reliance on AI or machine learning.

Strong integration of data visualization, geographic information systems (GIS), epidemiology, and deterministic modeling.
